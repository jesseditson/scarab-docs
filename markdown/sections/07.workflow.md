Development workflow

### `init`

Scarab includes a command called `init`, which handles resolving your parent app and setting up an initial project.

`init` takes a single optional argument, which is the npm-compatible package name of the scarab app you would like to extend.

For instance, to set up a single page app, you would use:

```bash

scarab init jesseditson/scarab-spa
```

This will initialize a basic single page app. Here's a screen recording of that process:

### `hosts`

running `scarab hosts` will add the IP of the socialcode docker machine to your /etc/hosts file, so that http://socialcode.dev will be pointed to your docker machine. This is especially useful when authenticating against APIs that require access from a specific host. As a result, all whitelists should include this hostname if they are expected to be accessible in development.

To remove this host, run `scarab hosts remove`.

### `install`

When installing compiled npm dependencies (like libsass or similar), you'll need to run `npm install` on the remote box, or any compiled deps will be compiled for darwin (and as a result, will not run in the docker container).

Instead of running `npm install`, run `scarab install`, and you will not have this issue. Under the hood, `scarab install` is just running a `scarab` service (as defined by your local docker-compose.yml file) with an entrypoint of `npm install`. Because the volume is mapped, you'll see your local `node_modules` folder change.

### `start`

Once you have your application set up, run `scarab start` to start the application. This will start the application in daemonized mode, which means you won't see any console output, but your app will be available at http://socialcode.dev (assuming you have run `scarab hosts`).

### `stop`

You can stop your application by running `scarab stop`. If you're unsure if your app is running, you can either just run `stop`, or run `scarab compose ps` to see what services are running on the `socialcode` docker machine.

### `logs`

While your app is running, you can tail the logs by running `scarab logs`.

> Note that docker sometimes disconnects with the message:

>     ERROR: Couldn't connect to Docker daemon - you might need to run `docker-machine start default`.

> This unfortunately is a known issue with docker, and prevents us from running apps in the foreground. Once docker-compose has resolved this issue, these docs will be updated.
> When you encounter this, you can just restart logging by running `scarab logs`.

To tail the logs of a service other than `scarab`, run `scarab logs <service>`. For example if you're just using scarab as a proxy and your app is running under the service name `go` (as defined in your docker-compose.yml file), you'd tail the go logs by running `scarab logs go`.

To tail the logs of _all_ services, run `scarab compose logs`. This is equivalent to running `docker-compose logs`. This is usually not preferable, as the logs do not have a limit (https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/265), and can disconnect randomly (https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/2338#issuecomment-158202641).

### `cleanup`

Docker leaves lots of artifacts on the VM when building apps. It's a good idea to clean these up occasionally, and so `scarab` comes with a command that removes unused artifacts, `scarab clean`. If you run in to odd behavior when starting images, it's possible that you're running low on VM space, so this command combined with `docker-machine restart socialcode` will usually resolve most issues.

### `compose`

`docker-compose` has a multitude of other commands that you can use to inspect or manipulate your services. Because of the way docker-compose.yml files are inherited by scarab apps, you'll use `scarab compose` instead of `docker-compose` whenever performing a compose command.
