### `init`

Scarab includes a command called `init`, which handles resolving your parent app and setting up an initial project.

`init` takes a single optional argument, which is the npm-compatible package name of the scarab app you would like to extend.

For instance, to set up a single page app, you would use:

```bash

scarab init jesseditson/scarab-spa
```

This will initialize a basic single page app. Here's a screen recording of that process:

### `start`

Once you have your application set up, run `scarab start` to start the application. This will start the application in daemonized mode, which means you won't see any console output, but your app will be available at http://socialcode.dev (assuming you have run `scarab hosts`).

### `stop`

You can stop your application by running `scarab stop`. If you're unsure if your app is running, you can either just run `stop`, or run `scarab compose ps` to see what services are running on the `socialcode` docker machine.

### `logs`

While your app is running, you can tail the logs by running `scarab logs`.

> Note that docker sometimes disconnects with the message:

>     ERROR: Couldn't connect to Docker daemon - you might need to run `docker-machine start default`.

> This unfortunately is a known issue with docker, and prevents us from running apps in the foreground. Once docker-compose has resolved this issue, these docs will be updated.
> When you encounter this, you can just restart logging by running `scarab logs`.

### `cleanup`

Docker leaves lots of artifacts on the VM when building apps. It's a good idea to clean these up occasionally, and so `scarab` comes with a command that removes unused artifacts, `scarab clean`. If you run in to odd behavior when starting images, it's possible that you're running low on VM space, so this command combined with `docker-machine restart socialcode` will usually resolve most issues.

### `compose`

`docker-compose` has a multitude of other commands that you can use to inspect or manipulate your services. Because of the way docker-compose.yml files are inherited by scarab apps, you'll use `scarab compose` instead of `docker-compose` whenever performing a compose command.
