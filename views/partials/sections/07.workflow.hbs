<p>Scarab includes a command called <code>init</code>, which handles resolving your parent app and setting up an initial project.</p>
<p><code>init</code> takes a single optional argument, which is the npm-compatible package name of the scarab app you would like to extend.</p>
<p>For instance, to set up a single page app, you would use:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">
<span class="hljs-keyword">scarab </span>init <span class="hljs-keyword">jesseditson/scarab-spa</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This will initialize a basic single page app. Here&#39;s a screen recording of that process:</p>

<p>(a large version of the above can be viewed <a href="http://f.cl.ly/items/0x1f1r3D2m0g0K0X0W0u/Screen%20Recording%202015-12-18%20at%2001.10%20PM.gif">here</a>)</p>
<h3 id="-start-"><code>start</code></h3>
<p>Once you have your application set up, run <code>scarab start</code> to start the application. This will start the application in daemonized mode, which means you won&#39;t see any console output, but your app will be available at <a href="http://socialcode.dev">http://socialcode.dev</a> (assuming you have run <code>scarab hosts</code>).</p>
<h3 id="-stop-"><code>stop</code></h3>
<p>You can stop your application by running <code>scarab stop</code>. If you&#39;re unsure if your app is running, you can either just run <code>stop</code>, or run <code>scarab compose ps</code> to see what services are running on the <code>socialcode</code> docker machine.</p>
<h3 id="-logs-"><code>logs</code></h3>
<p>While your app is running, you can tail the logs by running <code>scarab logs</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that docker sometimes disconnects with the message:</p>
<pre><code>ERROR: Couldn<span class="hljs-symbol">'t</span> connect <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> Docker daemon - you might need <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> run `docker-machine start <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span>`.
</code></pre><p>This unfortunately is a known issue with docker, and prevents us from running apps in the foreground. Once docker-compose has resolved this issue, these docs will be updated.
When you encounter this, you can just restart logging by running <code>scarab logs</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="-cleanup-"><code>cleanup</code></h3>
<p>Docker leaves lots of artifacts on the VM when building apps. It&#39;s a good idea to clean these up occasionally, and so <code>scarab</code> comes with a command that removes unused artifacts, <code>scarab clean</code>. If you run in to odd behavior when starting images, it&#39;s possible that you&#39;re running low on VM space, so this command combined with <code>docker-machine restart socialcode</code> will usually resolve most issues.</p>
<h3 id="-compose-"><code>compose</code></h3>
<p><code>docker-compose</code> has a multitude of other commands that you can use to inspect or manipulate your services. Because of the way docker-compose.yml files are inherited by scarab apps, you&#39;ll use <code>scarab compose</code> instead of <code>docker-compose</code> whenever performing a compose command.</p>
